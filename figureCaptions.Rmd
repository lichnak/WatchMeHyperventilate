__Figure X:__ \textcolor{blue}{Workflow illustration for the proposed pipeline.  Processing of the multi-modal
input MRI for a single subject, using the multi-modal symmetric template, results in
the generation of the feature images.  These feature images are used as input to the
Stage 1 RF model producing the initial RF probability map estimates.  The Stage 1
voting maps, the original feature images, and the Stage 2 RF model result in the
final voting maps which includes the WMH probability estimate.  Note that the RF models
are constructed once from a set of training data which are processed using the
same feature-construction pipeline as the single-subject input MRI.}

__Figure 1:__  Representation of Stage 1 feature images for subject 01C1019.  The
FLAIR, T1-, and T2-weighted images are rigidly pre-aligned
[@Avants:2014aa] to the space of the T1 image.  The three modality images are then preprocessed
(N4 bias correction [@Tustison:2010ac] and adaptive denoising [@Manjon:2010aa]) followed by
application of standard ANTs brain extraction and $n$-tissue segmentation protocols using
the MMRR symmetric template and corresponding priors [@Tustison:2014ab] applied to the T1 image.
The feature images are then generated for voxelwise input to the RF model which results in
the voting maps illustrated on the right.  This gives a probabilistic classification of
tissue type.  Not shown are the probability and voting images for the brain stem and
cerebellum.

__Figure 2:__  Sample FLAIR acquisition image slices showing both manual and random forest
segmentations for both stages obtained during the leave-one-out evaluation.  Manual
segmentations were performed by one of the authors and provided the ground
truth WMH labels for training the random forest models.

__Figure 3:__  Canonical views of the mutlivariate, bilaterally symmetric template constructed
from the MMRR data set [@landman2011] (only shown are the FLAIR, T1, and T2 modalities---
the components relevant for this work).  Template construction is detailed in
[@Tustison:2015aa].  These images are important for specific intensity-based
features.

__Figure 4:__ Average _MeanDecreaseAccuracy_ plots generated from the creation of all 24 random
forest models for Stage 1 during the leave-one-out evaluation.  These plots
are useful in providing a quantitative assessment of the predictive importance of each feature.
Features are ranked in descending order of importance.
The horizontal error bars provide the $95^{th}$ percentile
and illustrate the
stability of the feature importance across the leave-one-out models.
At this initial stage only 31 feature images are used.

__Figure 5:__  Average _MeanDecreaseAccuracy_ plots generated from the creation of all 24 random
forest models for Stage 2 during the leave-one-out evaluation.  These plots
are useful in providing a quantitative assessment of the predictive importance of each feature.
Features are ranked in descending order of importance.
The horizontal error bars provide the $95^{th}$ percentile
 and illustrate the
stability of the feature importance across the leave-one-out models.
We augment the 31 feature images from the first stage by adding an additional
seven voting maps and 7 segmentation posteriors from application of the Bayesian-based
segmentation for a total of 45 images for the second stage.

__Figure 6:__ (a) FLAIR image slice illustrating WMHs which have been manually delineated.
The region around the WMHs is enlarged (b) in the original FLAIR and the
(c) contralateral FLAIR difference image.

__Figure 7:__ Voxelwise comparison with manual delineation of white matter hyperintensities.
On the left are the
calculated Dice values over all white matter hyperintensities.  Note the improvement
in the Dice metric from the employment of the Stage 2 component of the processing pipeline.
(Right) Similar results can be seen by comparing the total lesion load volume between manual
and automated detection strategies.  Although some outliers are found after the Stage 2
processing in a couple subjects, the number of outliers caused by false positives is
decreased significantly with the second stage processing.
