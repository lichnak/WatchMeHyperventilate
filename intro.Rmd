## White matter hyperintensities in TBI

White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are foci of abnormally increased signal intensity seen within white matter regions within the cerebrum and brainstem on fluid attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. These lesions are distinguished from prominent perivascular spaces seen on T2-weighted imaging by the lack of fluid suppression of signal on FLAIR sequences. WMHs in the periventricular and deep brain regions are associated with normal aging and neurological conditions including hypertension and stroke. WMHs are also a frequent finding following traumatic brain injury (TBI) and have been correlated with functional outcome and injury severity in both pediatric [@Bigler:2013aa;@Smitherman:2016aa] and adult
[@Marquez-de-la-Plata:2007aa;@Moen:2014aa;@Ding:2008aa;@Pierallini:2000aa]. Further, the regional distribution and volume of WMHs have been shown to possess prognostic value in the TBI patient [@Pierallini:2000aa;@Weiss:2008aa;@Smitherman:2016aa;@Levin:1988aa]. Specifically, lesion volume in corpus callosum correlates with functional scores in the acute phase following injury, while lesion volume in frontal lobes correlates with scores at 1 year following injury [@Pierallini:2000aa]. Further, volume of FLAIR lesions within the corpus callosum, brainstem, and thalamus in patients with severe TBI correlates with Glasgow Outcome-Extended (GOS-E) scores [@Moen:2014aa]. Additionally, the regional distribution of FLAIR lesions within the pons, midbrain, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, parietal, temporal, occipital lobes, and insula along with the observation of grasping or chewing behavior are associated with poor outcome [@Weiss:2008aa].

Despite the above findings, outside of multiple sclerosis, WMHs are not routinely employed as a diagnostic measure in clinical practice. Their presence within asymptomatic patients or in association with a variety of conditions, such as stroke, dementia, neuroinflammatory conditions, and TBI challenge their utility in narrowing a radiological differential diagnosis. Further, performing a comprehensive manual counting of number and distribution of lesions in the clinical setting is simply not practical. Despite the limited inclusion of WMH observations in routine radiological reports, two large meta-analyses demonstrated an association between WMHs, cognitive function, increased risk of stroke, dementia, and death [@Debette:2010aa;@Kloppenborg:2014aa]. As such, the development of automated methods for the rapid identification and quantification of WMHs within individual patients may allow for identification of correlative patterns between WMH number, volume, distribution, and disease state. Further, the development of such lesion quantification approaches may allow for the practical inclusion of this type of information within routine radiological practice.

## Random forests for WMH segmentation


Machine learning and pattern recognition techniques have seen increased application
for various medical image analysis workflows (see, for example, the annual
Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging held in conjunction with the Medical
Image Computing and Computer-Aided Intervention (MICCAI) international meeting [@mlmi2015]).
Popular techniques such as support vector machines and neural networks have been applied
successfully to clinically relevant imaging tasks such as supervised image segmentation
(e.g., [@Bauer:2011aa]) and diagnostic prediction (e.g., [@Tong:2014aa;@Liu:2013aa]).
Facilitating the current employment of such techniques are the number of available imaging
data sets [@Van-Horn:2014aa] and the public availability of data science packages such as
SciPy [@scipy] and the R project for statistical computing [@R] and their associated
extensions.

The random forests framework [@breiman2001] is a popular machine learning technique that has
demonstrated significant utitility for supervised segmentation tasks (e.g.,
normal human brain segmentation [@yi2009]) and other computer vision applications
(e.g., human gait detection [@viola2005]).
In the context of neuropathology, random forest-based paradigms have been employed in the
delineation of multiple sclerosis lesions [@geremia2011], stroke lesions [@Pustina:2016aa],
and brain tumors [@geremia2012;@bauer2012;@zikic2012;@Tustison:2015aa].  Of note, these
latter random forest approaches for brain tumor segmentation have performed well in recent
international competitions.  In response to the lack of objective comparisons between
segmentation algorithms, the Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BRATS) challenge was initiated in
2012 [@Menze:2015aa] and has continued every year since under the auspices of the MICCAI
conference.

Random forests are conceptually simple [@breiman2001].  They consist of ensembles of decision trees
that are built from training data.  Once constructed, data to be classified is "pushed"
through each decision tree resulting in a single classification "vote" per tree.  These
votes are then used for regression or classification of the data.  Although decision
trees had been extensively studied previously, the success of employing collections of
such weak learners for boosting machine learning performance
(e.g., AdaBoost [@schapire1990;@freund1997]) influenced the similarly sytled conglomeration
of decision trees into "forests" with randomized node optimization [@ho1995;@amit1997].
Finally, Breiman [@breiman2001] improved accuracy by random sampling of the training
data (i.e., "bagging") resulting in the current random forest technique.

In this work, we develop a concatenated random forest framework with a tailored contextual
feature image set (both spatial and intensity-based)
for segmenting white matter hyperintensities in traumatic brain injury cohorts.  Additionally,
the entire framework is provided publicly through the well-known open-source
ANTs[^i1] and ANTsR[^i2] toolkits.  Further motivating the research of this work is
the public availability of the imaging data thus permitting full reproducibility
of the results reported and discussed.
