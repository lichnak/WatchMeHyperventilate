## Quantitative analysis

Machine learning and pattern recognition techniques have proven extremely useful
for various medical image analysis workflows (see, for example, the annual
Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging held in conjunction with the Medical
Image Computing and Computer-Aided Intervention international meeting [@mlmi2015]).
Popular techniques such as support vector machines and neural networks have been applied
successfully to clinically relevant imaging tasks such as segmentation
(e.g., [@Bauer:2011aa]) and diagnostic prediction (e.g., [@Tong:2014aa;@Liu:2013aa]).

Another versatile technique that has acheieved much success

The random forest machine learning framework provides an excelllent fromework for medical
image segmentation



Supervised methodologies are uniquely characterized, in part, by the feature images that
are used to identify the regions of interest.

Intensity information alone is insufficient for removing false positives.  For example,
as pointed out in [@Neema:2009aa], higher intensities can be found at the periventricular
caps in normal subjects which often confounds automated lesion detection algorithms.

![Representation of Stage 1 feature images for subject 01C1019.  Input for each
subject consists of FLAIR, T1-, and T2-weighted images which are rigidly pre-aligned
[@Avants:2014aa] to the
space of the T1 image.  The three images are then preprocessed (N4 bias correction
[@Tustison:2010ac] and denoising [@Manjon:2010aa]) followed by application of standard ANTs
brain extraction and $n$-tissue segmentation protocols using the MMRR
symmetric template corresponding and priors [@Tustison:2014ab] to the T1 image.  The
feature images are then generated for voxelwise input to the RF model which results in
the voting maps illustrated on the right which gives a probabilistic classification of
tissue type.
