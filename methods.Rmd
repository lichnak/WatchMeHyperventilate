Feature generation for the proposed framework is critical. The performance of the selected
machine learning strategy is limited by the input used for training. The image features
described below were selected based on previous work in the literature and our own observations
regarding tumor characteristics and what could possibly be encoded algorithmically.
Observations regarding tumor intensity differences from normal tissue has been encoded in
previously proposed research by calculating normalized neighborhood intensity statistics
and intensity modeling (e.g., Bauer et al. 2011, 2012; Geremia et al. 2012; Zikic et al.
2012). In these approaches both the features and classification algorithm are limited to
voxelwise considerations.

Our success in the MICCAI 2013 challenge was largely due to the inclusion of an extremely
important set of features based on the common observation of bilateral asymmetrization
caused by tumor presence. Additionally, several features were designed to encode spatial
coherence even though the RF classification is performed on a voxelwise basis. For example,
connected component geometry of the intensity modeling labels were used to discriminate
observations of compact, isotropic objects (vs. highly anisotropic) typical of tumor
presence and growth (Greenspan 1972). Table 1 provides a listing of image features used
and the motivation for their inclusion.
