![Average \texttt{MeanDecreaseAccuracy} plots generated from the creation of all 24 random
forest models for both Stage 1 and Stage 2 during the leave-one-out evaluation.  These plots
are useful in providing a quantitative assessment of the predictive importance of each feature.
The error bars provide the $95^{th}$ percentile (i.e., $1.96 \times \sigma$) and illustrate the
stability of the feature importance across the leave-one-out models.](Figures/averageLeaveOneOut.png)



To calculate this quantity for a single feature from a single random forest model, the
decrease in prediction accuracy produced by omitting the specified feature is calculated
during the out-of-bag phase of model creation.

During the out-of-bag error calculation stage of the random forest model creation, the
decrease in prediction accuracy with the omission of a single feature or variable is
tracked and averaged. Those features which have the greatest decrease in mean accuracy are
considered to be the most discriminative. In this work, we do not use these measurements for
feature pruning.
